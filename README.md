# Night Owls Detector

This script returns user names of Devman students who has ever sent
an assignment between 0:00 and 6:00 o`clock.

# How To Install

Python v3.5 should be already installed. 
Afterwards use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup)
to install dependecies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```
Remember that it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) 
for better isolation.
